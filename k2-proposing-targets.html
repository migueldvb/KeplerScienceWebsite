            <h1 class="entry-title">How to propose targets for K2?</h1>
            <div class="entry-content">
                
<p>There are no guaranteed, or predetermined, targets for any of 
<a href="k2-fields.html">the fields where K2 is pointing</a>.
All targets are proposed by the community 
through the Guest Observer (GO) program. 
This page details the program and its aims.</p>
<h2 id="programmatic-information">Programmatic Information</h2>
<h3 id="permitted-science-areas">Permitted science areas</h3>
<p>The GO Program welcomes proposals addressing compelling scientific questions 
in <strong>any area of astrophysics and planetary science</strong> 
providing the required observations are amenable 
to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission. </p>
<p>The science motivation may include, but is not limited to, 
exoplanet detection, stellar astrophysics, 
galactic and extragalatic astrophysics, and Solar System science. </p>
<p>All science proposals must be compelling and carefully justified
scientifically and technically. 
Proposers should particularly note that short (1-minute) cadence resources 
and bright targets are expensive in pixels and onboard storage 
and have historically been in high demand. 
Short cadence proposals must justify scientifically and technically the need for higher cadence monitoring relative to long cadence observations.</p>
<p>Proposers must take into account the difference between science 
that can be achieved exclusively using archived K2 and Kepler data 
and science that requires new observations by K2. 
The K2 GO program is specific to the case of science 
requiring new observations. 
Funding for archival science is provided through the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP; Appendix D.2 of ROSES-2015) instead. 
This includes all Kepler data and previous K2 Campaigns. </p>
<p>All proposals to the K2 GO calls must justify 
the need for new observational data within their program. 
However, we welcome proposals that build upon data already collected 
and programs requiring more data to enhance or complete investigations.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h3>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to GO calls will be evaluated 
with respect to the criteria specified 
in Section C.2 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, which are intrinsic merit,
relevance to the GO solicitation, 
and the realism/reasonableness of the proposed work effort and resources. 
In addition to the factors for intrinsic merit 
given in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, 
intrinsic merit includes the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The suitability of using the K2 observatory and data products for the proposed investigation;</li>
<li>The legacy value of the data collected;</li>
<li>The degree to which the investigation uses K2’s unique capabilities;</li>
<li>The feasibility of accomplishing the objectives 
of the proposed investigation with the requested observations, 
including the degree to which the proposal satisfies 
K2’s observational constraints; and</li>
<li>The feasibility and suitability of the proposed analysis techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="availability-of-funds">Availability of funds</h3>
<p>There are typically two categories of K2 guest observer proposals.
They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small proposals—proposals requesting fewer than 1000 targets, 
with a budget capped at $30,000.</li>
<li>Large proposals—proposals requesting 1000 or more targets, 
with a budget capped at $100,000. 
Large proposals must also include the development and dissemination 
of a value-added community resource product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Funding for selected programs typically starts upon availability 
of Campaign data to the Principal Investigator (PI).
All data will be made available through the public archive 
at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). 
There is no exclusive use period associated with any K2 GO data. </p>
<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>
<p>Application to the K2 GO program is typically open to all investigators,
including those from outside the U.S. 
under NASA’s no-exchange-of-funds policy. </p>
<p>Investigators who are not affiliated with a U.S. institution 
are not eligible for funding through this program,
but may submit proposals that will be reviewed and ranked 
along with eligible proposals for the purpose of allocating targets.</p>
<p>Co-Investigators (Co-Is) affiliated with a U.S. institution 
are eligible to receive funding under a proposal led by a foreign PI. 
In this scenario, only a single Co-Investigator per proposal will be considered as a lead PI for funding purposes, 
and proposals should identify a lead Co-Investigator within the U.S.</p>
<h2 id="target-selection">Target selection</h2>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>Pointed observations away from the single stare position of any given field 
cannot be accommodated by K2; Campaign targets are limited to the objects 
available in <a href="k2-fields.html">the fixed field of view</a>. </p>
<p>Small gaps between the 42 detector CCDs result in additional loss 
of available objects that would otherwise be within the Kepler field of view. 
A <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">documented target search tool at MAST</a> determines if an object of a particular coordinate 
lies close to the observable field of view. </p>
<p>The target search tool accesses the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC), 
which provides physical data, coordinates, magnitudes, and colors, 
for sources close to K2 silicon. 
The EPIC is complete only to m<sub>V</sub> ~ 17; 
specifications of the catalog are documented at
<a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf</a>. </p>
<p>It is the proposer’s responsibility to identify targets 
that are faint or missing from the EPIC. 
K2 collection of valid data relies on the delivery 
of accurate celestial positions and magnitudes of each target. 
Proposals must state the origin for this information, 
especially if it does not come from the EPIC. </p>
<p>Determining whether or not desired targets fall on active regions 
of the focal plane is also the responsibility of the proposer. 
The Kepler Science Center provides a tool at 
<a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/ToolsK2FOV.shtml">http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/ToolsK2FOV.shtml</a> 
to identify which targets fall upon active silicon. 
Only those targets within the active fields of view should be proposed.</p>
<h3 id="target-table">Target table</h3>
<p>All proposals for targets are required to include a target table 
in a pre-defined format to specify desired observing modes 
and other needed parameters. </p>
<p>A definition of each column and a template for insertion into the proposal 
may be downloaded from the Kepler Science Center website at 
<a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/ProposalPreparationTargetTable.shtml">http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/ProposalPreparationTargetTable.shtml</a>. </p>
<p>In addition to appearing as text within the proposal, 
this table must also be submitted electronically to the Kepler Science Center. </p>
<h2 id="sollicitations">Sollicitations</h2>
<h3 id="campaigns-8-9-10">Campaigns 8-9-10</h3>
<p>Final pointings for <a href="fields.shtml#8">Campaign 8</a> (RA = 01:05:21.12, Dec = +05:15:44.45), <a href="fields.shtml#9">Campaign 9</a> (RA = 18:01:25.08, Dec = -21:46:47.32) and <a href="fields.shtml#10">Campaign 10</a> (RA = 12:27:07.07, Dec = -04:01:37.8) have been set. We are requesting the community propose the targets to observe during Campaigns 8 and 10, while they propose to join the a Microlensing Science Team for Campaign 9.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal deadline</strong><br/>
  Step 1: 23:59 EST June 02, 2015<br/>
  Step 2: 23:59 EST July 01, 2015<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anticipated duration of campaigns</strong><br/>
  Campaign 8: Jan 3-Mar 26, 2016. Campaign 9: Apr 7-Jul 6, 2016. Campaign 10: Jul 6-Sep 21, 2016. Start and stop dates are approximate, flexible and could be overtaken by unanticipated operational events.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One proposal or two?</strong><br/>
  In the interest of efficiency, proposers are requested <em>NOT</em> to provide separate proposals with identical science cases for each of the campaigns. If the same science goals are spread across both campaigns, please provide one science justification and two target tables, one for each field.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Target Selection</strong><br/>
  In order to avoid inefficiency for Proposers, you are encouraged to use the online tool <a href="ToolsK2FOV.shtml">K2fov</a> to determine whether your targets fall upon silicon and propose only those that do. The precision of this tool is a few 4"x4" arcsec detector pixels. The tool has been updated for the boresight pointings of campaigns 8, 9 and 10.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Should you apply for targets that do not fall on Silicon?</strong><br/>
  Please, no. The boresight locations for Campaigns 8, 9 and 10 are set. Proposing off-silicon targets is a waste of energy for proposers, reviewers and Project staff. Use <a href="ToolsK2FOV.shtml">K2fov</a> and apply only for targets that fall upon silicon (output flag "2").<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The K2 Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC)</strong><br/>
  Proposers are asked to submit targets that have been selected from the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">EPIC</a>. The EPIC plays the same role for K2 that the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..112B">Kepler Input Catalog (KIC)</a> played for Kepler target selection. The primary purpose of the catalog is to define photometric apertures for each potential target by providing celestial positions and Kepler bandpass magnitudes. EPIC parameters are produced by source matching existing multi-band catalogs and calculating color corrections for the Kepler bandpass. The EPIC has been updated with campaign 6 and 7 sources. Documentation describing the compilation of the EPIC is provided <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/documents.html">here</a>.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What type of science targets can be proposed?</strong><br/>
  There are no constraints on the type of science or science target that can be proposed.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How many targets can be proposed?</strong><br/>
  Both long cadence (30-min exposure) and short cadence (1-min exposure) targets will be observed during this campaign. There are no constraints whatsoever on the number of targets that can be proposed. The total long cadence target list is expected to be approximately 20,000 targets per campaign. Approximately 100 short cadence targets are anticipated per campaign.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How many pixels around each target will be collected?</strong><br/>
  This is currently unquantified, but K2 target pixel masks are anticipated to be significantly larger than Kepler pixel masks. Extra halos of pixels will be added to K2 masks in order to capture uncertainties in field acquisition (currently a pixel) and pointing drift over time (currently a pixel).<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there bright or faint magnitude limits?</strong><br/>
  There are no faint limits upon the brightness of targets that can be proposed. Bright targets will be significantly more expensive in terms of pixel usage. Targets brighter than 3rd magnitude in the Kepler bandpass cannot be observed because charge bleeding along CCD pixel columns will fall into collateral pixels of the detector. Bright targets and short cadence targets will requires strong, compelling science cases.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I submit a proposal?</strong><br/></p>
