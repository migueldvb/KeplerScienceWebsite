<p>There are no guaranteed, or predetermined, targets for any of 
<a href="k2-fields.html">the fields where K2 is pointing</a>.
All targets are proposed by the community 
through the Guest Observer (GO) program. 
This page details the program and its aims.</p>
<h2 id="guest-observer-program">Guest Observer program</h2>
<h3 id="permitted-science-areas">Permitted science areas</h3>
<p>The K2 GO program welcomes proposals addressing compelling scientific questions 
in <strong>any area of astrophysics and planetary science</strong> 
providing the required observations are amenable 
to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission. The science motivation may include, but is not limited to, 
exoplanet detection, stellar astrophysics, 
galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and solar system science. </p>
<p>All science proposals must be compelling and carefully justified
scientifically and technically. 
Proposers should particularly note that short (1-minute) cadence resources 
and bright (Kp &lt; 9) targets are expensive in pixels and onboard storage 
and have historically been in high demand. 
Proposals for short cadence or bright targets must have a very strong scientific and technical
justification.</p>
<p>Proposers must take into account the difference between science 
that can be achieved exclusively using archived K2 and Kepler data 
and science that requires new observations by K2. 
The K2 GO program is specific to the case of science 
requiring new observations. 
Funding for archival science is instead provided through the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (<a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&amp;solId={7EC3A68D-0FF5-627D-C6EF-03D6FDE528FB}&amp;path=closedPast">ADAP; Appendix D.2 of ROSES-2015</a>). 
This includes all Kepler data and archived data from K2 Campaigns. All
proposals to the K2 GO calls therefore must justify 
the need for new observational data within their program. 
However, we welcome proposals that build upon data already collected 
and programs requiring more data to enhance or complete investigations.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h3>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to GO calls will be evaluated 
with respect to the criteria specified 
in Section C.2 of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/">NASA Guidebook for Proposers</a>, which are intrinsic merit,
relevance to the GO solicitation, 
and the realism/reasonableness of the proposed work effort and resources. 
In addition to the factors for intrinsic merit 
given in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, 
intrinsic merit includes the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The suitability of using the K2 observatory and data products for the proposed investigation;</li>
<li>The legacy value of the data collected;</li>
<li>The degree to which the investigation uses K2â€™s unique capabilities;</li>
<li>The feasibility of accomplishing the objectives 
of the proposed investigation with the requested observations, 
including the degree to which the proposal satisfies 
K2â€™s observational constraints; and</li>
<li>The feasibility and suitability of the proposed analysis techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>All proposals are peer-reviewed and ranked by a panel of professional volunteers, followed by ratification from NASA Headquarters. The members of the peer-review panel will not be disclosed. The deliberations of the panel will be disclosed to PIs only after ratification by the selecting official.</p>
<h3 id="availability-of-funds">Availability of funds</h3>
<p>There are typically two categories of K2 GO proposals.
They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small proposalsâ€”proposals requesting fewer than 1000 targets, 
with a budget capped at $50,000.</li>
<li>Large proposalsâ€”proposals requesting 1000 or more targets, 
with a budget capped at $150,000. 
Large proposals must also include the development and dissemination 
of a value-added community resource product that the proposal will provide at the end of the period of performance of the grant and how that product will be made available to the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Funding for selected programs typically starts upon availability 
of Campaign data to the public archive 
at <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/">MAST</a>. 
Note that there is no exclusive use period associated with any K2 GO data. </p>
<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>
<p>Application to the K2 GO program is typically open to all investigators,
including those from outside the U.S. 
under NASAâ€™s no-exchange-of-funds policy. </p>
<p>Investigators who are not affiliated with a U.S. institution 
are not eligible for funding through this program,
but may submit proposals that will be reviewed and ranked 
along with eligible proposals for the purpose of allocating targets.</p>
<p>Co-Investigators (Co-Is) affiliated with a U.S. institution 
are eligible to receive funding under a proposal led by a foreign PI. 
In this scenario, only a single Co-Investigator per proposal will be considered as a lead PI for funding purposes, 
and proposals should identify a lead Co-Investigator within the U.S.</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 113--76, Division B, Title V, Section 532, NASA cannot support bilateral participation, collaboration, or coordination with China or any Chinese-owned company or entity, whether funded or performed under a no-exchange-of-funds arrangement. See Section III(c) of the ROSES-2014 NRA for more information on these restrictions. </p>
<h2 id="target-selection">Target selection</h2>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>Pointed observations away from the single stare position of any given field 
cannot be accommodated by K2; Campaign targets are limited to the objects 
available in <a href="k2-fields.html">the fixed field of view</a>. </p>
<p>Small gaps between the 42 detector CCDs result in additional loss 
of available objects that would otherwise be within the Kepler field of view. 
A <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">documented target search tool at MAST</a> determines if an object of a particular coordinate 
lies close to the observable field of view. </p>
<p>The target search tool accesses the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC), 
which provides physical data, coordinates, magnitudes, and colors, 
for sources close to K2 silicon. 
The EPIC is complete only to m<sub>V</sub> ~ 17; 
specifications of the catalog are <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">documented here</a>. </p>
<p>It is the proposerâ€™s responsibility to identify targets 
that are faint or missing from the EPIC. 
K2 collection of valid data relies on the delivery 
of accurate celestial positions and magnitudes of each target. 
Proposals must state the origin for this information, 
especially if it does not come from the EPIC.  Extended targets or
targets with high proper motion should also be noted by the proposer.</p>
<p>Determining whether or not desired targets fall on active regions 
of the focal plane is also the responsibility of the proposer. 
The Kepler Science Center provides a tool called
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov to identify which targets fall upon active silicon</a>. 
Only those targets within the active fields of view should be proposed.</p>
<h3 id="target-table">Target table</h3>
<p>All proposals for targets are required to include a target table 
in a pre-defined format to specify desired observing modes 
and other needed parameters. </p>
<p>The target tables generally provide all the information required by the Kepler Science Center to incorporate GO sources within the observing list. Table fields are described below with an example. If a proposal includes targets within multiple campaign fields, then a separate target table should be prepared for each field.</p>
<p>An example of a valid target table is shown in the image below. <a href="data/K2/K2-2-propnum-PI.xls">The corresponding .xls file can be downloaded here.</a></p>
<p><a href="images/template-target-table.png"><img alt="Template Target Table" class="img-responsive" src="images/template-target-table.png"/></a></p>

<h2 id="solicitations">Solicitations</h2>
<p>The call for K2 GO Cycle 4 proposals, which includes <a href="k2-fields.html">Campaigns 11, 12,
and 13</a>, has been released and
<a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&amp;solId={7A635D8E-1B2B-2488-5E0D-5C81471D150B}&amp;path=open">is available at NSPIRES</a>. We
are requesting the community propose targets to observe
during only these three Campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the proposal deadlines?</strong><br/>
  Step 1: 2016 Feb 05 <br/>
  Step 2: 2016 Mar 04 <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the anticipated dates of the campaigns included in the
current solicitation?</strong><br/>
Campaign 11: 2016 Sep 24 - Dec 08 <br/>
Campaign 12: 2016 Dec 15 - 2017 Mar 04 <br/>
Campaign 13: 2017 Mar 08 - May 27 <br/>
Start and stop dates are approximate, flexible and could be overtaken by unanticipated operational events.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One proposal or two?</strong><br/>
  In the interest of efficiency, proposers are requested <em>NOT</em> to provide separate proposals with identical science cases for each of the campaigns. If the same science goals are spread across both campaigns, please provide one science justification and two target tables, one for each field.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I select targets on silicon?</strong><br/>
  In order to avoid inefficiency for proposers, you are encouraged to
  use the online tool <a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov</a> to
  determine whether your targets fall upon silicon and propose only
  those that do. The precision of this tool is a few 4x4 arcsec
  detector pixels. The tool has been updated for the boresight
  pointings of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Should I apply for targets that do not fall on silicon?</strong><br/>
  Please, no. The boresight locations for Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 are set. Proposing off-silicon targets is a waste of energy for proposers, reviewers and project staff. Use <a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov</a> and apply only for targets that fall upon silicon (output flag "2").<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the K2 Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC)?</strong><br/>
  Proposers are asked to submit targets that have been selected from the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">EPIC</a>. The EPIC plays the same role for K2 that the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..112B">Kepler Input Catalog (KIC)</a> played for Kepler target selection. The primary purpose of the catalog is to define photometric apertures for each potential target by providing celestial positions and Kepler bandpass magnitudes. EPIC parameters are produced by source matching existing multi-band catalogs and calculating color corrections for the Kepler bandpass. Documentation describing the compilation of the EPIC is provided <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">here</a>.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What type of science targets can be proposed?</strong><br/>
  There are no constraints on the type of science or science target that can be proposed.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How many targets can be proposed?</strong><br/>
  Both long cadence (30-min exposure) and short cadence (1-min
  exposure) targets will be observed during each Campaign. There are
  no constraints whatsoever on the number of targets that can be
  proposed. The total long cadence target list is expected to be
  between 10,000 and 20,000 targets per Campaign. Approximately 50 to 100 short cadence targets are anticipated per Campaign.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How many pixels around each target will be collected?</strong><br/>
  The number of pixels collected for each target depends on the
  target's Kepler magnitude.  For Kp = 12, the target pixel masks include
  approximately 100 pixels.  Extra halos of pixels will be added to K2 masks in order to capture uncertainties in field acquisition (currently a pixel) and pointing drift over time (currently a pixel).<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there bright or faint magnitude limits?</strong><br/>
  There are no faint limits upon the brightness of targets that can be
  proposed. Bright targets will be significantly more expensive in
  terms of pixel usage. Targets brighter than 3rd magnitude in the
  Kepler bandpass cannot be observed because charge bleeding along CCD
  pixel columns will fall into collateral pixels of the
  detector. Bright targets (Kp &lt; 9) and short cadence targets require strong, compelling science cases.<br/></p>

<h3 id="submission-process">Submission process</h3>
<p>K2 proposal submission is a 2-step process. Both steps are
mandatory. To propose for Campaigns 11, 12 and 13, investigators are
required to submit Step 1 through the NSPIRES website by 23:59 EST
February 5, 2016 and are required to submit Step 2 to the NSPIRES
website by 23:59 EST March 4, 2016. All proposers need to register
with NSPIRES in order to submit both parts of the proposal. The
separation of the proposal into two steps is required in order to
expedite the completion of review administration and target
engineering before the start of Campaign 11. Detailed instructions for
submitting a K2 proposal to the GO call are provided below:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the material required for your proposal. The generic content of the proposal is described in Sec 2.3 of the
    <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/">NRA Proposers Guide</a>. Page
    limits and proposal content within the NRA Guide are amended
    within the

    Note that the Scientific/Technical/Management section of the
    Step-2 proposal, which consists of text, tables (excluding the
    Target Table), and figures must not exceed four pages for
    proposals in the Small category, or six pages for proposals in the
    Large category. An additional 0.5 pages is allowed in Large proposals to describe
    progress the proposers have made to delivering value-added
    community resources.  References do not count against the page
    limit. In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the scope of the
    Guest Observer program. Science papers exploiting data from the Kepler and K2 mission can be found <a href="publications.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="data-products.html#documentation">technical documentation</a> for the mission.</li>
<li>Develop and justify a science concept for observations
      within Campaigns specific to the current GO Cycle <a href="fields.html"></a>.</li>
<li>Identify appropriate targets for the proposed observations using the
    <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">K2 Target Search</a> page as the primary (but not exclusive) source list. This search page provides for the construction of short or long target lists based upon e.g. celestial cone searches, magnitude and color.</li>
<li>Complete the <a href="k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table">Target Table</a> as an integral component of the proposal and as a separate submission to the Guest Observer Office.</li>
<li>Provide the administrative elements of the proposal
      including a proposer biographical information, and a
      statement of current and pending financial support.</li>
<li>Although a detailed budget is not requested in either Step-1 or
  Step-2 proposals, the statement of work in the Step-2 proposal
  should clearly identify any and all members of the proposing team
  who would receive funding under the proposed investigation. The
  funding amounts will be determined formulaically based on target
  allocation.</li>
<li>Large proposals that anticipate delivery of a data product/products
  to one of the NASA archives (e.g., MAST or the NASA Exoplanet
  Database) for curation must also include a letter of acknowledgement from
  the relevant archive.</li>

<p><strong>Special instructions for non-US PIs</strong><br/>
During the submission process, non-US PI-led proposals will need to be
affiliated to a submitting organization. Do this by clicking on the
"Account Mgmt" tab at the top of the NSPIRES page and follow the
instructions. All non-US proposals should use the "Kepler Guest
Observer Office" as your affiliation within NSPIRES. This is simply a
fudge, albeit a required fudge, so that non-US PIs spend no more
effort than this over the institutional endorsements that are
mandatory for US investigators.<br/>
<br/>When completing the proposal, there are a few obscure boxes on the standard form that need your attention. The organization name is "Kepler Guest Observer Office", doing business as the "Kepler Guest Observer Office". The DUNS number is "999999954" and the cage code is "ZZZ54". These details will make sense to you when you see the Step 2 proposal form. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table summarizes the content of material to be supplied
by the Principal Investigator in support of a K2 GO proposal. This
package is to be uploaded to NSPIRES during the process of submitting
electronic proposals. Descriptions for the content of each element are
provided in sec 2.3 of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/proposer2015.pdf">2015 NRA Proposers Guidebook</a>. The
right-hand column provides page limits for the package elements. Page
limits on this web site override the NRA-generic limits within the
handbook. Caveats to the page limits are provided as footnotes. The
completed package upload must not exceed 15 pages. If a large target
table extends beyond the 15 page limit then truncate the table so that
the page limit is not exceeded and make a note within the proposal
that the table has been truncated. PIs should not feel compelled to
meet the page limits, but must submit all items appropriate to their
proposal.</p>

<h3 id="directors-discretionary-time">Director's Discretionary Time</h3>
<p>A small part of the pixel budget may be allocated by the project as Director's Discretionary Targets (DDT),
which is intended to facilitate observations that address
scientific topics missed in the proposal review process.
More information and deadlines are available from the <a href="k2-ddt.html">DDT program page</a>.</p>
